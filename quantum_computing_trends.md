## Key Trends (February-March 2026)

### 1. Horizontal Scaling - The New Frontier

**InterQo Project (€4M)**
- Pasqal and Welinq launched €4M project to build "Quantum Ethernet"
- Focus: Network neutral-atom processors via light connections
- Shift from "vertical scaling" (adding qubits to one chip) to "horizontal scaling" (chip clusters)
- Goal: Million-qubit systems

### 2. D-Wave's Dual-Platform Strategy
- Revenue surged 179% in 2025
- Acquired Quantum Circuits Inc. (QCi) for gate-model systems
- Now offers both quantum annealing AND fault-tolerant computing
- $30M+ bookings in January 2026 alone
- Headquarters moving to Florida

### 3. Space-Based Quantum Sensors
- **Monarch Quantum** selected by NASA JPL
- Quantum Gravity Gradiometer Pathfinder (QGGPf) mission
- Can map groundwater from space
- Chip-scale quantum light engines

### 4. Control Electronics Miniaturization
- QED-C and NIST completed research to shrink control systems
- Moving from room-sized labs to data center racks
- Blueprint for compact quantum "control rooms"

### 5. Quantum Machine Learning
- **Xanadu + Lockheed Martin** joint research initiative
- Quantum generative AI applications
- Error correction advances

### 6. Enterprise Adoption
- Korean national strategy (SKKU + Classiq)
- Quantum software education initiatives
- Defense sector involvement (Pentagon contracts)
